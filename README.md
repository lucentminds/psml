The acronym "psml" stands for Python S(omething I don't remember anymore) Markup Language. Back when I was first interested in learning Python I wanted to be able to do simple things with it the same way PHP worked. So the idea was that you have regular html page with `<?py ...?>` tags that enclosed code that needed to be parsed with Python. It was mostly an experiment and I'm sure there are better solutions for __real__ Python programmers out there.
